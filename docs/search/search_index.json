I am a Principal DevOps Engineer with a diverse background of computers, vendors, and technologies. I strive for stable and reliable infrastructure while utilizing modern deployment standards in an ever-changing enterprise software market. Background I started working at a Data Center as a Linux help desk sysadmin. As skills built, I started looking at other technologies within the Data Center eventually finding myself managing the network and day to day operations within the facility. It was a lot of long hours and thankless webmaster tickets closed, but it was home and I enjoyed it. After some time I decided my time there was at a close and I parted ways to take the next step in my career, DevOps. Because I had a large exposure to many different aspects in the OSI Model, DevOps was a natural next step for me. Trouble shooting skills and reliability models were engrained in my mind and design of resilient, redundant infrastructure came natural to me. I have many different configuration management languages under my belt, however, I prefer ansible . Additionally, I love to write python for tooling and fun. I have several projects I would like to cover in blog format, so please come back from time to time and visit!","title":"About Nick the Gray"},{"location":"about/#about-nick-the-gray","text":"","title":"About Nick the Gray"},{"location":"about/#nick-the-gray","text":"Thanks for dropping by, my name is Nick.

I think it probably still does, but malls don't exactly exist in my mind anymore. When I was a teenager, I was a bit of a mall rat due to an addiction to Pump It Up . Since I had a (small) disposable income as a teenager with a job and a car, I had the pleasure to buy strange things. I am also a bit of a nerd, so I got a dragon lamp. I used to take this thing to a local LARP (yeah, that much of a nerd) and hang it on the wall as a mood light. Here's a photo of the dragon today: One thing to note, the lamp part of this dragon is completely redone. I wanted an art project to flex my creative bone and that's what this project is about. What is it? I found this dragon in a box when moving into my new house. After opening the globe-like lamp to replace the bulb, a thought went through my mind. \"Why would you use a tiny christmas light in this thing?\" A friend introduced me to neopixels LED's in the past and I wanted to use one to make this globe really shine. Hardware I needed a way to use a raspberry pi zero w and a neopixel ring together. Because +5V is native to the raspberry pi, the 3V data path the neopixel ring operates on requires a level stepper to accomplish and properly address each light in the array. Lucky for me, the chip shortage didn't start yet so I got a few from adafruit. Build requirements: 74AHCT125 - Quad Level-Shifter (3V to 5V) (1) 5V 4A (4000mA) switching power supply NeoPixel Ring - 12 x 5050 RGB LED with Integrated Drivers Breadboard Flux Solder Soldering Iron Once I had all the hardware, the wiring was pretty simple: From: https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-wiring","title":"Bandwidth Dragon"},{"location":"projects/odahviing/#bandwidth-dragon","text":"This article is currently WIP Once upon a time a store called Spencers Gifts existed.
