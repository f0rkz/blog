Background \u00b6 I started working at a Data Center as a Linux help desk sysadmin. As skills built, I started looking at other technologies within the Data Center eventually finding myself managing the network and day to day operations within the facility. It was a lot of long hours and thankless webmaster tickets closed, but it was home and I enjoyed it. After some time I decided my time there was at a close and I parted ways to take the next step in my career, DevOps. Because I had a large exposure to many different aspects in the OSI Model, DevOps was a natural next step for me. Trouble shooting skills and reliability models were engrained in my mind and design of resilient, redundant infrastructure came natural to me. I have many different configuration management languages under my belt, however, I prefer ansible . Additionally, I love to write python for tooling and fun. I have several projects I would like to cover in blog format, so please come back from time to time and visit!","title":"About Nick the Gray"},{"location":"about/#about-nick-the-gray","text":"","title":"About Nick the Gray"},{"location":"about/#nick-the-gray","text":"Thanks for dropping by, my name is Nick.

After phase 1 investigation, I found the drain was backed up. Either the condensate pump on my downstairs HVAC stopped pumping properly, or there was a clog in the very short PVC piping leading from the HVAC to the pump (this is very likely). I grabbed the 5 horsepower shopvac that I use for dirtier jobs and water, and created a large amount of suction around the P trap of the drain. There is a little stand pipe there for natural drain utilization and sight inspection that I used to try and clear the clog. After sucking a good amount of water out, I discovered nothing in particular wrong with the drain aside from the normal sediment, mold, and debris inside. After clearing the pipe, I decided to drain into a 5 gallon bucket for the night and remove the current very old condensate pump. I woke up to a bucket of water, so I now know the drain was unclogged. Water is gross when its in a pipe. Today I went to Home Depot and purchased a new condensate pump. Once I was home, I installed the new pump and tested the drain as well as the condensate pump's function. All in tip top shape, but that HVAC unit is starting to show it's age. It may be a matter of time until it breaks. Alas, I am an engineer! I can solve these problems as they come. Anyhow, all that to say, its really hot out on the planet. I've had enough of these hot summers and winters. I hope we aren't headed for human caused disaster due to our own stupidity, but here we are.

I think it probably still does, but malls don't exactly exist in my mind anymore. When I was a teenager, I was a bit of a mall rat due to an addiction to Pump It Up . Since I had a (small) disposable income as a teenager with a job and a car, I had the pleasure to buy strange things. I am also a bit of a nerd, so I got a dragon lamp. I used to take this thing to a local LARP (yeah, that much of a nerd) and hang it on the wall as a mood light. Here's a photo of the dragon today: One thing to note, the lamp part of this dragon is completely redone. I wanted an art project to flex my creative bone and that's what this project is about. What is it? \u00b6 I found this dragon in a box when moving into my new house. After opening the globe-like lamp to replace the bulb, a thought went through my mind. \"Why would you use a tiny christmas light in this thing?\" A friend introduced me to neopixels LED's in the past and I wanted to use one to make this globe really shine. Hardware \u00b6 I needed a way to use a raspberry pi zero w and a neopixel ring together. Because +5V is native to the raspberry pi, the 3V data path the neopixel ring operates on requires a level stepper to accomplish and properly address each light in the array. Lucky for me, the chip shortage didn't start yet so I got a few from adafruit. Build requirements: 74AHCT125 - Quad Level-Shifter (3V to 5V) (1) 5V 4A (4000mA) switching power supply NeoPixel Ring - 12 x 5050 RGB LED with Integrated Drivers Breadboard Flux Solder Soldering Iron Wiring Diagram \u00b6 Once I had all the hardware, the wiring was pretty simple: From: https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-wiring I soldered the components together and stuffed a raspberry pi zero w inside as the brain of my little dragon friend. I have a functioning linux lamp, now what? \u00b6 Now that I have everything together I need to create an application to control the lights. Recently, I had equipped the home network with a Ubiquity Dream Machine Pro (or UHD for now on). The UHD can run docker (actually podman) containers quite easily and netdata provides an API to get data back. With those things known, the decision is easy. This lamp will monitor my bandwidth! Now that I am thinking back on it, I should have made it react to the weather. Maybe for a future project...
